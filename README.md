### Arctic Liquid III vs. Thermalright LGA1700-BCF

Short Story: </br>
Not compatible... </br>

Thermalright LGA1700-BCF is Only compatible with older Arctic Liquid 2 / II </br>

IF want to use Thermalright LGA1700-BCF + Arctic Liquid III / 3 </br>
try the optional:  </br>
ARCTIC Intel LGA1700 Upgrade Kit - for Liquid Freezer II Series  </br>
Maybe could work, Untested / Unknown. </br>

Tested: </br>
Arctic III waterblock / pump must use the included Arctic III 1700 mount place </br>
its very frustrating to screw just 2-screws !  </br>
But also feel very easy using the proper technique. </br>

grabbing the waterbloc/punp from the back with right hand, if you are right handed </br>
alight holes, push down firm + rolling motion </br>
waterblock screws very easy, but the back of the Arctic Waterblock </br>
must must be facing the center of the board, Not the edge, Not the Dr.MOS Heatsink, </br>
even if has 1mm clearance, makes grabing the heatsink wrong, and becomes frustrating to screw. </br>

The 1700 mounting plate: </br>
Arctic 1700 plate requires different screws "included", </br>
Thermalright LGA1700-BCF requires the original socket screws. </br>

Must be very careful Not to overtight, board cracks like Bones Joint Noises. </br>
Must be very careful All Screws have similar pressure / tension </br>
"screw all in X pattern, then Unscrew each in X pattern by small 90ยบ / 180ยบ / 360ยบ </br>
and again several times smaller turns, until all feel the same, </br>
Not overtight, Not lose, No Joint Noises." </br>
Thermalright LGA1700-BCF seems easier / faster to achieve proper tension </br>
probably because plate is flatter </br>
Arctic can be overtight more easy if Not careful. </br>

must place the CPU on the original mount to protect the socket pins, </br>
proper Triangle on the corner alignment, But... Not close the mechanism. </br>
Unscrew the original socket cpu mount with included tool </br>
back plate in some boards are Not glued, </br>
its metallic with a plastic layer in between the board and the back plate. </br>
your PC case must have back door open, board horizontal, and lifted like a vehicle on a shop lift hoist </br>
you need to hold the back plate with 1 hand to avoid falling or moving, </br>
while remove the mounting mechanism on the top with the other hand </br>
and screw the New mounting plate. </br>
glueing the back plate with thin double side tape its a temptation, but... </br>
does Not allow free movement to mount the CPU, needs a small tolerace to have perfect alignment. </br>
Back plate + board socket holes + plastic socket on the front + socket pins + cpu + mounting plate </br>

Thats it... works perfect when done properly. </br>
