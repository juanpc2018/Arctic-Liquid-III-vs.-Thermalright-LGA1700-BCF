### Arctic Liquid III vs. Thermalright LGA1700-BCF

Short Story: </br>
Not compatible... </br>

Thermalright LGA1700-BCF is Only compatible with older Arctic Liquid 2 / II </br>

IF want to use Thermalright LGA1700-BCF + Arctic Liquid III / 3 </br>
try the optional:  </br>
ARCTIC Intel LGA1700 Upgrade Kit - for Liquid Freezer II Series  </br>
Maybe could work, Untested / Unknown. </br>

Tested: </br>
Arctic III waterblock / pump must use the included Arctic III 1700 mount plate </br>
it can be very frustrating to screw just 2-screws !  </br>
But also feels very easy using the proper technique. </br>

grabbing the waterblock/pump from the back with right hand, if you are right handed </br>
peal the protection layer, alight holes: waterblock & mounting plate, push down firm + rolling motion inward</br>
alternate waterblock screws, very easy!</br>
But the Arctic Waterblock+Pump must be facing the center of the board, Not the edge, Not the Dr.MOS Heatsink </br>
even if has 1mm clearance, makes grabing the waterblock+pump wrong, and becomes frustrating to screw. </br>

The 1700 mounting plate: </br>
Arctic 1700 plate requires different screws "included", </br>
Thermalright LGA1700-BCF requires original socket screws. </br>

Must be very careful Not to overtight, board cracks like Bone Joint Noises. </br>
Must be very careful All Screws have similar pressure / tension </br>
"screw all in X pattern, then Unscrew & Screw again each, by small 90ยบ / 180ยบ / 360ยบ </br>
several times in X pattern, smaller turns, until all feel the same </br>
Not overtight, Not lose, No loud Joint Noises, must be done in a quiet environment, lowest noise hours </br>

Thermalright LGA1700-BCF seems easier / faster to achieve proper tension </br>
probably because BCF plate is flatter, </br>
Arctic can be overtight easy if Not careful. </br>

before installing place the CPU on the original mount to protect the socket pins, </br>
Align Triangles on the corner, But... do Not close the retention mechanism. </br>
Unscrew the original cpu mount with included tool </br>
1700 back plate in some boards is Not glued, </br>
its metallic with a plastic layer in between the board and the back plate </br>

hold the back plate with 1 hand to avoid falling or moving, without too much pressure on the board </br>
while removing the mounting mechanism on the top with the other hand </br>
and screw the New mounting plate with 1 hand. </br>

your PC case must have back door open, board horizontal, and lifted like a vehicle on a shop lift hoist </br>
if the back plate moves or fall, needs a flashlight or cellphone light on the back to align holes again </br>
glueing the back plate with thin double side tape its a temptation, but... </br>
does Not allow free movement to mount the CPU, needs a small tolerace to have perfect alignment: </br>
Back plate + board socket holes + plastic socket on the front + socket pins + cpu + mounting plate. </br>

Works perfect when done properly. </br>
